# Instead of controls, move the camera towards activity
- When placed, if it is not the center, move 1 tiles towards it.

# Other ideas
- Regionize?
- Everytime it completely envelopes another color, it turns it into itself.
- Blocks disintigrates into points
- A block that every quarter? beat goes to an adjacent valid square.
- Be able to undo your previous block.
- Be able to save a block for later.
- Unlock more blocks in the future.

# Natural Sounds
- Change pitch for every repeated sound.

# Musical Blocks
- Water dripping is musical :D

# Musical Ambience Timer
Each placed block should advance the music beat.
- If more block is placed before the beat, then it will simply continue the music normally. In other words, placing blocks can only slow the music, but never speed it up.
- This can serve as an opt-in timer/challenge to keep the music playing.

# SEAWEED
- Only grows in full water blocks on top of dirt.
- When the block should become NOT FULL, it turns into just water.
